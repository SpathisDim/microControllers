DEVELOPMENT OF APPLICATIONS FOR THE VIRTUAL PICSIMLAB BOARD (PIC18F452)

Part1<br>
->Function date_Time() (reads the time and date from the completed DS1307 and stores it in the external EEPROM 24C02)<br>
->Function stepMotor() (drives a stepper motor)    <br>
->Function adc_and_servo()  ( It will drive a servomotor connected to the RC2 with a frequency of 500 Hz and a pulse width proportional to the                               percentage you have entered (0 -255). )       
<br>
Part2<br>
(Will display in the first row of the built-in LCD the last name and first name stored in EEPROM)
<br>
Part3<br>
(I use Interrupts to test the operation of peripherals while the main program will perform another function.)
